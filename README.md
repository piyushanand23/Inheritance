# Inheritance
Theory:
The capability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from another class is called Inheritance. Inheritance is one of the most important features of Object-Oriented Programming.
Inheritance is a feature or a process in which, new classes are created from the existing classes. The new class created is called “derived class” or “child class” and the existing class is known as the “base class” or “parent class”.

Types of Inheritance in C++:
Single Inheritance: In single inheritance, a class is allowed to inherit from only one class. i.e. one subclass is inherited by one base class only.
Multiple Inheritance: Multiple Inheritance is a feature of C++ where a class can inherit from more than one class. i.e one subclass is inherited from more than one base class.
